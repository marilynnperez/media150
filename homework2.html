<h2> Image A</h2>
<h2>Leading Lines</h2>
<img src="imageA.jpeg" alt="Image A" style="border: 5px solid black; width: 500px; height: 300px;">
<P> For Image A I decided to focus on leading lines, guiding the viewer to see the pathway between the two goups of people. The dark contrast between the two groups of people allows there to be a defined pathway in betweeen them.</P>
<h2> Image B </h2>
<h2> Symmetry</h2>
<img src="DSC00203.jpeg" alt="Image B" style="border: 5px solid black; width: 300px; height: 200px;">
<p> Image B focuses on symmetry, the balance between the posters alows there to be a symmetric feel between all 6. The bright colors of all the posters against the blank white wall creates a visible contrast emphasizing on the symmetry.</p>
