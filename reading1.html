    <h1>"In Plato's Cave"</h1>
    <h3> By Susan Sontag</h3>
<p> In the reading "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag, it dives deep into the different realities of photography. While reading this article I was perosnally astonished by the multiple interpretations Sontag had about photography. Three important analogies that stuck out to me were, photography is a unique interpretation of one's own viewpoint, photographers are just as important as the picture taken, and how modern photography is emotionally desensitizing.</p>
<p> When we look at a photograph, we arent simply looking at a quick snapshot but instead looking at the deeper meaning on what the photgorapher intended to capture. Sontag argues that this ideology isn't true, but we all as humans have our own unique interpretations of looking at a photograph. Personally this is something that I've always thought as well, noone can capture the same idea from a single photograph. Thats what makes phtographs so important because they dont have any phsyical words on it but speak so much. In the world we are currently living in, with social media being almost everyones top way of passing time, photos are a perfect direct way to spread news around. Sontag said "Photographs may be more, memorable than moving images, becuase they are a neat slice of time" (5). Sontag is completly right most of the time moving images can get too overwhelming while a simple photo shot speaks for itself. </p>
<p> We tend to forget that there wouldn't be any photographs without the photgorapher. Sontag gave a timline of how photogropahy came about and how it was initially looked at. She stated how initially there were barely any people who owned a camera so no one had a standard to live up to and shot with their creative mind. In recent days, it's fair to say that there's a certain aesthetic to up to par in order to share your pictures. Even then knowing it takes talent to take pictures people often give credit to the camera. We don't realize the talent and patience it takes to get the perfect shot. Having to sit in the same spot because one simple thing is off. Unfortunate that photographers usually don't get much credit considering they hold so much power within one picture.  </p>
<p> Unfortunately, modern photography has become more of a chore instead of a memory. Sontag explains this by tourism. Many people throuoght the year go around the world and 99% of the time they will take pictures. The key idea to takeaway is that photography has become more about capturing and bragging instead of living in the moment and taking in what you're seeing. I completely agree with this analogy because even I catch myself taking continuous pictures when instead I should appreciate what's infront of me. It can be argued that taking pictures is a way to hold memories forever but they will never compare to experience it present time.   </p>
<p> Overall, I found this reading interesting and educational. Sontag wasn't afraid of voicing the way phtography is evolvig. She's trying to bring awareness that photography is unique to everyone, how photographers unfortunately don't get needed recognition, and losing its emotional touch.  </p>
