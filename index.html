    <p>Hi! My name is Marilyn Perez and I am a sophmore at Hunter college, studying human biology and aspiring on becoming an OB-GYN. Taking this media course is far beyond my comfort, but I wanted to try something new. I am into photography, I used to take pictures for my higschools sports teams in a club called newrophotos. I did this for the enterity of my senior year and even sometimes took pictures for some club teams in my town. With these pictures I would edit them to my liking and I was able to try new things. This initiated my love for photography and being able to finding my aesthetic in the outside world. For example, nature is something that really grasps my interest when taking pictures.   </p>
    <p>Aside from photography, I'm also intrested in photoshop, editing, and just basic artistry. It really interests me how people are able to express themselves within their art wether it be physical or digital art. I'm intrested in the abstarct aspect of media, being able to interpret many things from just one digital piece, or even being able to relate these things to real world events. Something else that I'm exctied to explore is the iteractive story, I feel like this will really challenge my creativity in great ways.   I am not too informed on the abundance of medias or designs, but I'm open and ready to learn more about these. </p>
